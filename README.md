# Introduction
This repo is my first mindstone in learning the AI model <br>
The aim for this repo is to make a fully funtional chess game<br>
with local console pvp, pve and eve<br>

Basically the hardest part is the eve<br>
Since I want to train a AI model for playing the chess<br>

Hope you will enjoy<br>
